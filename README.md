# Firefly Algorithm
The firefly algorithm (FA) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm developed by Xin-She Yang that is inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies (Yang, 2008), originally designed to solve continuous optimization problems

An optimization problem refers to the maximization or minimization of an objective function by setting suitable values for the variables from a set of feasible values. These problems appear not only in complex scientific studies but also in our day-to-day activities.
